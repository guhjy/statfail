# To the editors

We hereby submit for your consideration a second revision of our manuscript on "A common misapplication of statistical inference: nuisance control with null-hypothesis significance tests". We have received excellent and timely reviews, for which we are grateful, and which have allowed us to further refine the manuscript into a very concise form. We have provided a detailed reviewer response letter laying out how we have dealt with the reviewer's comments.

We have to express our gratitude with regards to the quality and speed of the review and editorial process, and hope that *Brain & Language* will be able to help us share our work with the community.
