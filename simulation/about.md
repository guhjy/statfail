Sassenhagen, Jona and Phillip M. Alday (under review): A common misapplication of statistical inference: nuisance control with null-hypothesis significance tests. Brain & Language. [arXiv preprint](http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04565). [Repository](https://github.com/jona-sassenhagen/statfail/). 

The title will probably change in the near feature, as some of our initial reviewer feedback has been some very helpful terminological suggestions.

Another Python-based simulation will soon be made available on Binder, but the preliminary code is already in the GitHub repository.

A more comprehensive aggregrate, static simulation showing the effects across many settings of the simulation parameters simultaneously will be made available on RPubs in the near future.
